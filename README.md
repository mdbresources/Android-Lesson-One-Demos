# Lesson One Android Demos

These are the demos presented in lecture 1. 

(1) Notebook - This demo is to show the process of constructing a basic app from scratch. It demonstrates how to make layout files using the Android Studio Layout editor, use Constraint and Linear Layouts, and connects the UI components to the Activity Code. It also demonstrates how to make OnClickListeners, use intents with extras, and display toasts to the user. There is also some file utilities in this project, but they are not the focus of this demo.

(2) Vote Counter - This demo is primarly to show how to read photos and resource files programatically. This demo reads a text file of votes, tallies them up, and them reports them in a list, next to a picture of the candidate. The rest of the code is for demo purposes only and should not necessarily be considered good practice code.
